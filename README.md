# Vietnamese Text Generation

## About the project
The topic I choose for this project is Text-to-text Generation. I'll try to finetune a LLM for Vietnamese Text Generation Task, using optimization techniques like PEFT, LoRA, etc., with the goal of experimenting with approaches to large models on limited hardware (e.g., free hardware from Colab or Kaggle). I'll also try to use some distil models and compare the result with their teachers. 

## What I will do
- Researching about the techniques that I used, such as Causal Language Model, LoRA, half-precision training, some metrics that used in Text Generation Task.
- Convert the model to ONNX and compare the two versions in terms of speed and efficiency.
- Create a demo with Streamlit (or Gradio).
- Dockerfile.
